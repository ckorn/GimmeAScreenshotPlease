# GimmeAScreenshotPlease
Takes a screenshot and sends it to the client

Can be turned in client and server mode.
In servermode it waits for a client who wants a screenshot and delivers it over .NET named pipes. No webserver required.
In clientmode you can ask the server to make a screenshot and send it back.

The use case is simple:
I want to play Fallout 4!

Unfortunately, the loading speed it limited by the frames per second.
I know there is a fix for it by unlimiting the frames in some ini file.
Then the game loads within seconds instead of several minutes!
(But some mechanics like lockpicking are broken then because you just move to fast).

But, I play the game over Steam Link on my TV. Problem there is, that
Steam then limites the game to like 60 FPS. Probably to speed up encodings.
But now my problem with the game taking several minutes to load is back again.

To make it load quickly, I have to disable Steam Link, wait for some seconds
and enable it again when the game has loaded.

But I also have a notebook next to me when I play in my living room
(PC is in another room).

So when I disable Steam Link, I just look at this app to see when the loading screen
is gone and enable Steam Link again ^^
